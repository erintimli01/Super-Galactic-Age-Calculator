## Description

_This is a student-made application for testing business logic with Jest and using ES6 features. Here you will find a space calculator to determine your age on different planets based on a planet's solar years, how many years have passed since a certain age, and how many years to until a certain age! All on different planets such as Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter!_

_Project objectives:_
* _Returns their age in Mercury years. (A Mercury year is .24 Earth years.)_
* _Returns their age in Venus years. (A Venus year is .62 Earth years.)_
* _Returns their age in Mars years. (A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years.)_
* _Returns their age in Jupiter years. (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.)_
* _Determines how many years have passed on each planet since a past birthday. For example, if a user is 56 and we want to calculate how many years have passed since their 43 birthday, we would find the following results:_
* _13 Earth years have passed._
* _54.16 Mercury years have passed._
* _8.06 Venus years have passed._
* _6.91 Mars years have passed._
* _1.09 Jupiter years have passed._
* _Determines how many years have yet to pass until a future birthday. For example, if a user is 56 years and we want to calculate how many years have yet to pass until they are 61 years old, we would find the following results:_
* _5 Earth years have yet to pass._
* _20.83 Mercury years have yet to pass._
* _20.96 Venus years have yet to pass._
* _2.65 Mars years have yet to pass._
* _0.42 Jupiter years have yet to pass._
